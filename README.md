# Timetable Generator Project
Semi-Graphical interface to generate timetables automatically based on class and lab requirements. Class 12 Year end Project.

## How to Use
1. Download the "main.exe" file and execute it or download the "main.cpp" file and compile it. 
2. Enter the name, number of classes and the names of the teachers.
3. Select option 2 to obtain the timetables. 
4. A copy of the timetables of the students, teachers, labs are also stored in the respective txt files for fututre access.

## Description
Timetables lie at the heart of educational systems, allowing for the smooth and efficient functioning of educational institutions. Even though technology has advanced forward, timetables are still by and large made by hand (especially in India). The project aims to combat this by ensuring a equal distribution of lectures across the day and the week for both student and teachers. Our program first takes in the required number of classes for each optional subject, accounting for variation over different syllabi. It then recursively assigns classes and labs, while adhering to constraints such as teacher, student and lab availability. The project is modelled on the timetable of the Science stream of a typical Indian 11th or 12th class, assigning 7(Theory) + 2(Lab) hours per week per subject for core subjects with varying hours for others. The timetables generated help avoid excessive exertion and increase productivity of an educational institution.

Note: A detailed description and analysis (along with sample inputs and outputs) is provided in the "Timetable_Project_Brief.docx" file.
